# EveryHelloWorld

Lol.

There's no build/run instructions. Just a lot of `Hello World!`

# Add a language

If you would like to make a PR with a language, please make sure it follows these guidelines

1) It prints **exactly** `Hello World!` (case sensitive and including the exclamation mark where possible. No comma)
2) It must not be an esoteric language
3) For the love of god use 4/tab spacing
4) It doesn't necessarily need to be a programming language, but keep it programming related
